Disruptive innovation is the process of transforming expensive or complex products or services into products or services that are more inexpensive, improved, compact and accessible to a wider audience. Disruptive innovation are that product or system which completely change current scenario.  This change causes market disruption by replacing long-standing, well-established rivals.\\

some of the Disruptive Innovation in Healthcare are :-\\

\textbf{1) Telemedicine :-} It is one of the most impact-full Technology. Doctors can reach to more people who don’t like to or can’t afford to go to a doctor. Finally, Telemedicine can save money for everyone by minimizing hospital visits, freeing up hospital rooms for those who need them, as well as the schedules of healthcare providers. Remote care will only continue to become more optimized, disrupting healthcare with its promise of real-time communication, improving quality of life, making health care more accessible, and saving money. Overall in this technology person can checked by doctor even from very far distance.

\textbf{2) Artificial Intelligence and machine learning :-} AI and Ml in healthcare can improve patient outcomes by improving preventative care and quality of life, producing more accurate diagnosis and treatment strategies. Infectious illness outbreaks can also be predicted and tracked with AI. Using patient data and other information, AI can help doctors and medical providers deliver more accurate diagnoses and treatment plans. With the help of Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning, personalised robots and website is possible, which can help to personalised communicate or take-care if he/she facing any issue like depression, or something they don't able to tell.  \\

\textbf{3) 3-D Printing :-} 3D printing impacts many industries in reducing labor costs while increasing production rates, and healthcare is one industry tapping into its enormous potential. Although initial prices may be high, 3D printing technology is developing rapidly every day, reducing the cost of manufacturing prototypes, prosthetics, tissue and skin, and even pharmaceuticals.\\

\textbf{4) Cloud Computing :- }Cloud Computing is just an online server where you store your data or manage it and that data will only visible to those who have correct ID and password. This is just opposite  to establishing an on-site data center with servers, or hosting the data on a personal computer. Cloud computing in healthcare describes the practice of implementing remote servers accessed via the internet to store, manage and process healthcare-related data. Cloud computing and storage can help to compact devices and fast if we store and calculate data on other servers.\\

\textbf{5) Blockchain :-} One of the major concern in today era is data security. Best solution for this problem is blockchain .Blockchain is a database technology that uses encryption and other security measures to store data and link it in a way that it  enhances security and usability. With this technology all the personal details of patient should be secure.
