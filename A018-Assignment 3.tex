Healthcare changes tremendously because of technological developments, from anesthetics and antibiotics to magnetic resonance imaging scanners, AI. Future technological innovation is going to keep transforming healthcare. There will be fundamental shift from manual technology to automatic or AI based. We know that disease will never be completely eliminated, but surely we able to identify disease earlier, through data science and AI like technology. \

Future of health care is Artificial intelligence, data and computers. Majority of thing would be going to automatic and AI based. That day is not far when your operation is done by robots instead of humans because of their more accuracy. Because of all new innovations, medication would be easily reachable and at cheaper cost to rural areas also.

\section{Most probable changes in future of health care:-}

following are the points how health care look like in future :-\\

  
   
   1) In current situation treatment of cancer is very  difficult to cure, but in future health care evolved such that it can identify  such disease before adverse situation and also able to prevent it.\\
  
2) That day is not far when doctors can able to cure blindness and diabetes like problems through nano-medicines.\\

3) We know that aged people need personalised take care, that gap will be filled by robots.\\

4) In future distance treatment will polished, for example patient scan his eye and send to doctor and doctor can recognize that is patient suffering from eye problem or not.\\

5) Drones will be transport vehicles for emergency need of blood or organ.\\

6) We know that future is age of nano-medicines and nano-technology. we can assure that nano-particles and nano-devices will soon operate as precise drug delivery systems, cancer treatment tools or tiny surgeons. For an example, pillcam is a nano-device.\\

7) In future, with the help of 3D-printing we can bring wonders in all aspects of healthcare. We can print bio-tissues, artificial limbs, pills, blood vessels and many things. \\

8) Our future of health care is AI. Because it has immense power to design treatment plans or create drugs way faster and accurately than any human.
